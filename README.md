# WikiDetective

## Launch Instructions
Ensure that you have Flask installed.
After cloning into the repo, you can launch the game locally by typing `flask run`.

## Inspiration

Creepy Wikipedia articles featured on sites such as Youtube and BuzzFeed.

## What it does

Wiki Detective is a noir murder-mystery game which allows the player to utilize Wikipedia articles to solve a detailed murder case.

## How we built it

We used Flask (a Python microframework) and JavaScript to create an animated, immersive text-based experience.

## Challenges we ran into

We had a few challenges getting the animated typewriter style text display working.  We ended up switching building tools multiples times in order to find the right utilities.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Getting the game into a working state that allows the player to actually experience the entire storyline and really get into the plot of the game.

## What we learned

We learned that in the future we should come in with an idea as it used a lot our time to decide on a good idea for a project.  We also learned that we should have some sort of plan on how we are going to accomplish a task before the hackathon actually starts as we ran into a lot of issues switching from tool to tool.

## What's next for WikiDetective

Expanding the overall plot, adding immersive music, and making the overall UI more appealing.
