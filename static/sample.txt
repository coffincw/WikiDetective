PUZZLE_GOES_HERE
You go to the library to research, and look up the portrait in like a big book about art history.
A few days pass and you are once again called into the police chief’s office. You begin to mention the photographs, but he interrupts and informs you there has been a breakthrough in the case. 
Introduce and discuss serial killer — had a large killing spree about 10 years ago, and the autopsy suggests suggests this new body matches hisMO. However, judging by when he must have buried the body (construction time frame etc), the murder occurred about 7 years ago, after the killerhad seemingly been inactive for several years. This raises a few questions. 
But in the past, the killer was known to intentional dispose of his bodies in a semi-public way, ensuring they would eventually be found. Whywould he have disposed of this body in a different way? 
And why would he have waited so long to kill again?
