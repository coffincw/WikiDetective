Upon examining the photographs included with the body, they’re very disconcerting. The victim is dressed up and posed, but was also obviously already dead when the photo was taken, which is super creepy. The case historian suggests it shares a similar, eerie quality with the famous painting the “Arnolfini Portrait” by Jan van Eyck. She says this similarity may reveal something about the killer’s motivation for taking the photographs. What could the two have in common?
